# Frontend Mentor - Product List with Cart Solution

This is my solution to the [Product list with cart challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-list-with-cart-5MmqLVAp_d) on Frontend Mentor. This challenge helped me strengthen my HTML, CSS, and responsive layout skills. I'm currently working on the JavaScript functionality.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- Tailwind CSS (utility-first)
- CSS Grid & Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive design techniques
- Local fonts (TTF and variable)
- JavaScript (in progress)

---

### What I Learned

- How to load and use local and variable fonts with Tailwind
- Building complex, responsive grid layouts using custom `grid-template-rows/cols`
- Responsive design using `@media` variants in Tailwind (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`)
- Clean project structure using `/assets`, `/data`, and `/components` folders
- Setting up Tailwind CLI watch mode and controlling it (`Ctrl + C`)

```css
/* Example of grid row with fractional units */
.grid-rows-[8fr_2fr] {
  grid-template-rows: 8fr 2fr;
}

### Continued Development

- Finish JavaScript functionality (cart, modal, reset logic)
- Add transitions/animations with Tailwind and/or GSAP/Framer Motion
- Add accessibility improvements (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)
- Consider refactoring into React or Vite for better scalability and component-based structure
